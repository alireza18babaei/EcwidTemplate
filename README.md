ðŸ›’ Ecwid-Inspired eCommerce Landing Page
This is a fully hand-coded landing page inspired by the layout and content of the Ecwid eCommerce platform.
It was built using HTML5 and CSS3 only â€” without any frameworks or libraries â€” to demonstrate clean structure, layout skills, and attention to detail.
Styling is done using CSS selectors (no utility classes), with layout built using both Flexbox and CSS Grid to ensure flexibility and responsiveness.
